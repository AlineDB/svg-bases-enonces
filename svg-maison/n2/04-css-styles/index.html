2.11 A Polygon Roof
     Our house is looking good — however the rain pools up on our roof and is starting to cause leaks! Replace the rectangle roof with a polygon roof!
     1°) Delete the rectangle roof we currently have
     2°) Create a simple polygon element. Set the class attribute to roof. Don't worry about coordinates yet
     3°) Give the new polygon a points attribute set to these new, leakproof roof points: 256,148 262,203 80,203 87,148 327,148

2.12 Order Matters
     Something went awry when exporting our flower! All three elements (one line and two circle elements) should be visible. However, we can only see one of the circle elements.
     1°) Rearrange the elements so that both circle elements are visible in the Preview section along with the line for our flower stem.
